# CTDS-Parallel-Methods

This project demonstrates multiple methods to parallelise Casacore Table Data System (CTDS).
Some example methods are:

1, Parallel CTDS storage managers such as AdiosStMan.

2, Concatenated tables as used in Multi-MesurementSet tables.

3, Non-locking CTDS interface.

Some benchmarking code are also included to provide a platform for comparing these methods.
