# CTDS-Parallel-Methods
The ConcatTable class of Casacore Table Data System (CTDS) offers methods to virtually concattenate multiple physical tables (SubTable) into a single logical table (Master Table). Thus, in this program, we use diffrerents process written each underlying physical table in parallel. And use master process (rank = 0) to create the single logical table. This program provide an excellent scalability in I/O throughput since each physical table is only handled by an individual process, which naturally avoids inter-process synchronizations and parallel data alignment issues.
